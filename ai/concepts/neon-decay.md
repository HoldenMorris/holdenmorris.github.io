Concept 2: Neon Decay (Dark Wave Industrial)

This concept focuses on the "Dark Wave" and "Neon Terminal" aspects, emphasizing the contrast between deep, light-absorbing textures and vibrant electrical energy.

Color Palette: Base colors of Indian Blue ($#0C1565$) and Scarlet Gum ($#461659$) provide a moody, dark wave backdrop.

Visual Highlights: Project cards feature "Neon Glow" effects using stacked text-shadow layers (e.g., Neon Pink $#FF1493$ or Electric Blue $#0FF0FC$).

Materiality: The background is a procedural "oxidized metal" texture. This is achieved by stacking a fractalNoise SVG filter over the dark wave base colors using mix-blend-mode: multiply.

Lit Integration: Each project card is a reactive LitElement that "flickers" into life when hovered, increasing the blur-radius of its neon shadows from $10$px to $40$px dynamically.
