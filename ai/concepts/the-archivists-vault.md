Concept 3: The Archivist's Vault (Brutalist Git-Noir)

This concept highlights the "Git project" and "Archival" nature of your request, using a raw, unpolished, and technical layout.

Typography: Strict reliance on Akzidenz-Grotesk or IBM Plex Sans to maintain a "monopolistic corporate" or "industrial job-printing" feel.

Interface Layout: A brutalist, grid-based architecture with visible "rivets" (CSS-generated circles with metallic gradients) and stark borders.

Functional Features: An integrated "Documentation Vault" that pulls your saved AI chat logs (stored as Markdown in your /docs folder) and renders them through a CRT-styled viewer.

Process Transparency: A "Live Technical Writer" component that displays real-time Git commit history for the portfolio itself, rendered in a monospaced "Terminal Green" font ($#39FF14$) with a pulsating cursor.
